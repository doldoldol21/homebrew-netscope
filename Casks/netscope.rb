  # Quit the running menu-bar app before its bundle is replaced; on upgrade,
  # Homebrew reopens what it quit once the new version is in place. Without
  # this the old build kept running over the new bundle.
  uninstall quit: "io.netscope.app"

  # The app ships a root daemon (netscoped) inside the bundle; on first launch it
  # installs a root-owned copy under /Library/PrivilegedHelperTools and a launchd
  # service (one admin prompt). Later releases refresh that copy without a prompt.
  # Uninstall removes the app but the daemon remains; see README for cleanup.
  # version + sha256 above are kept current by .github/workflows/bump.yml.
